		 * HashSet in Java
The HashSet class in Java is part of the java.util package and implements the Set
interface. It is a collection that uses a hash table to store elements and ensures that there are no
duplicate elements in the collection.
Key Features of HashSet
1. No Duplicates: A HashSet does not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add a
duplicate, it will simply ignore it.
2. Unordered: The order of elements in a HashSet is not maintained. It depends on the hash
value of the elements.
3. Allows Null: A HashSet can store one null element.
4. Not Synchronized: HashSet is not thread-safe.
LinkedHashSet in Java
The LinkedHashSet class is part of the Java Collections Framework and extends the
HashSet class. It implements the Set interface and maintains a linked list of the entries in the
set. This allows LinkedHashSet to maintain the insertion order of elements, unlike
HashSet.
Key Features of LinkedHashSet
1. Maintains Insertion Order: Elements are stored in the order they were inserted.
2. No Duplicates: Like all Set implementations, LinkedHashSet does not allow
duplicate elements.
3. Allows Null: Can store a single null element.
4. Performance: Similar to HashSet but slightly slower
5. Not Synchronized: Not thread-safe.
List And Set
1. Duplicate are allowed
1.Duplicate are not allowed
2.Insertion order preserved
2.Insertion order is not preserved
3.Multiple null element can be stored
3.Null Element can store only once
4.Element by their position can be access
4.Element by their position can not be access
5. List implementations classes are ArrayList, Linked List,Vector
5. Set implementations classes are HashSet, Linked HashSet,TreeSet
