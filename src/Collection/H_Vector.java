Vector : The vector is the same as an array. 
It has components that can be accessed using anindex value. 
Vectors can contain a legacy method that is not part of the collection framework.
Key Features of Vector
1. Dynamic Array: Automatically resizes when elements are added or removed.
2. Thread-Safe: Synchronized methods make it suitable for multi-threaded environments.
3. Legacy Class: Introduced in Java 1.0, but still widely used for legacy code.
4. Random Access: Implements RandomAccess for fast access to elements.
